# Adversity

Your life is going to be a series of mistakes; of missed opportunities, failed expectations, and people telling you no.

There will of course be successes, and you should be humble on those occasions. There will be opportunities that you've won, so be grateful for them too. Sometimes things will go as expected, and people will often tell you yes - be thankful, of course.

But I don't really need to tell you how to deal with success, or that you should take opportunities. And I don't need to tell you how to manage when things go your way or when people let you do what you want.

This is because we not defined by our easy moments - we're defined by how we respond to adversity.

Remember: When things go wrong, how you act is who you are.
