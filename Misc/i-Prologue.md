# Prologue

This book is one of a pair of books, almost identical in every way. They differ in two fundamentals: their title, and their purpose.

## Happiness Is Free

This title belongs to my intended and somewhat utopian daydream of sharing my work for free. It is just that - I believe that everyone has access to, opportunity for, and a right to happiness. Charging people for happiness, just seems quite odd. I love sharing happiness, and it’s this sharing that is at the core of my own positive experiences.

It’s available in PDF, and in other digital formats, for free. Gratis. Not a single penny.

## Happiness Is A Choice

This title belongs to my understanding and acceptance of that fact that while happiness is indeed free - there are many things in life that are not. For instance, a paperback version of this book would cost someone somewhere some money - ideally, I could give that to you for free as well, though short of winning the lottery, I’m currently unable to.

I like to think that the ideas presented in this book are of value, and that having a physical version of it would be something you’d appreciate. Perhaps, knowing a book-loving friend, you’d buy it for them as a gift. Or maybe, that you would like to express your generosity and extend it in my direction - and thus purchase either a physical book, or a digital copy - both of which might help me as a “struggling author”.

It’s exactly the same as the free version, no bonus, nor any extras. Your gesture, if I am to be so fortunate, will be pure.

If you can’t afford the paid version, or you don’t ascribe sufficient value to my work to hand over your ‘dosh’ - you would be doing me a great service in sharing my endeavour. By sharing, if not my ideas, my intention.

If I’ve caused you to think at all, even if only in criticism - or I’ve inspired you to create better ideas than you’ve found in my book, please venture forth and bring that into the world; make it real.

In all likelihood - if you’ve got this far, you’ve either got too much time on your hands, or you’re a kindred spirit and share a not dissimilar journey to my own. To seek out, and offer where you can: a difference.

To the former I’d like to give thanks to the serendipity, the badgering friend, or the general sense of having nothing better to do prior to picking this up. I’d like to thank you also, for the privilege of your time - enjoy.

To the latter I’d like to say, “welcome”. I’m so very grateful for the honour of being selected as part of your conscious journey. While I can’t possibly know how we’ll reciprocate, or whether our journey will join beyond this medium - I can tell you it’s my very genuine wish that you find success in your journey.
