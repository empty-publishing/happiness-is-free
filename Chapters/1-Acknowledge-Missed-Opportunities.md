# Acknowledge Missed Opportunities

I hold a door open for about a hundred people every school day. Each day I pick up about 20 to 30 bits of litter from around the school and the local community. I seek out at least one person each morning, and each afternoon and sincerely ask them if they are okay. I say at least one genuine apology, and at least one honest thank you. I'm always looking for smiles to create, frowns to change, opportunities for genuine impact, and moments to just be silly.

I'm never 100% successful in these things, but they are habits that I've formed. The trick to building such a portfolio of good stuff to do - is acknowledging missed opportunities.

If I neglect the chance to open a door - I don't make a big deal out of it. I just acknowledge that I could have done better, and go open another.

I used to notice myself not reacting quickly enough to help someone pick something up that they'd dropped. Later, I'd think about my internal critic that questioned whether they needed my help; or if someone else would do it, or if I had time, or if it would be socially awkward. I'd then think about the delay my mind had created which lost me the opportunity to do something small for someone. I'd tell myself, I could have responded better and reacted more quickly.

I used to decide not to pick up a bit of litter in the street because other people don't do it, and they'd think I was strange. I noticed that this thought pattern was removing my opportunity to do something good, and forced myself to do it in front of other people.

Just the acknowledgement alone is enough, if you do it often, itâ€™ll change the way you do things. It changes the way you think, respond, and behave.

Remember: When new thinking habits form: more opportunities are taken, more good is created, more gratitude is received, more happiness is experienced.
