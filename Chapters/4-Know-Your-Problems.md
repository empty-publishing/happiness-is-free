# Know Your Problems

The definition of a problem, is “something with a solution”. If it’s not got a solution, it’s not a problem, it’s a fact.

If you ever find yourself tackling an actual problem (with the above definition), and you’re not acting on an available solution - you’re making a choice. You’re choosing not to fix it. That choice might be reasonable; it might be too costly, too time consuming, perhaps even too risky, or frankly you might not be that bothered by it.

Alternatively, you might see something as a problem - but in reality none of the solutions that others might use are available to you, in which case: is it still a problem, or a fact?

Notice that one person’s problem, is another person’s fact - and vice versa.

The distinction between problems and facts is an important one, because living with facts and living with choices create very different experiences. If you get them mixed up, if you don’t understand what problems you have, or what facts you’re dealing with - you become lost and unable to respond in a healthy way.

Remember: If it’s not got a solution, it’s not a problem, it’s a fact.
