# Change The World

Everyone tells you to change the world, when you're young. But nobody tells you by how much. Rarely do we discuss what it means, or what it looks like, or how to do it. You may never have the opportunity to create global, sweeping, and powerful change - but does that mean any effort you make isn’t worth it?

The world is a big place. But your world, your corner of it, is as big or as little as you need it to be. It'll grow with you, expanding when you've got the energy - and it'll contract when you need a rest.

We rarely notice our own impact on the world around us. We’ve been taught to ignore it, because it’s somehow wrong to feel good or to feel a deep sense of purpose. Well, it’s just not wrong at all. We should absolutely ensure we’re being humble; but taking pride in making a difference changes our lives for the better.

The smiles you create. The relief that you offer. The times you’ve been there for someone and you didn’t even know they needed it. The tears you’ve swept away. The hugs you’ve given. The reassuring look across the room. The times you’ve forgiven someone that truly needed it. The times when you’ve helped without thinking. They all have meaning.

Even if you create just a tiny difference - make it count. Build on it. Learn from it. Encourage it. Let it grow. Before you know it you’ll see what a wonderful place this planet is, and you’ll find endless opportunities to make a difference.

Remember: Even if you only change your world, you’ve made a difference to the rest of it.
