# Introduction

This is not a book about meditation. Meditation can be challenging for a lot of people, and this book - rather than purport to make it easier to do, or make it appear more compelling - is not an attempt to persuade you to begin practice. Rather, this book intends to help you create some of the changes found as a result meditation; without actually needing to do it.

It isn’t a cheat, or a quick fix; and you’ll find no secret here. Instead you’ll find advice and strategies that, if followed, will increase your ability to be happy - or at the very least provide you with healthy ways to think about happiness.

Just like meditation, it does demand some investment of time and energy. It requires a very different type of investment to that required of those new to meditation - so if you find sitting quietly impossible, your own thoughts a bit scary, or are genuinely so confused that you can’t even make a start - you now have at least one alternative.

## Should I stop or avoid meditation?

Meditation isn’t the problem being tackled by this book. If you can do it, or if you’re willing to put in the time to try, then that’s wonderful. In so doing, you will enjoy the benefits described in many thousands of scientific research papers - it works.

I cannot provide similar robustness of experimental evidence - so I cannot, then, suggest that regions of your brain will change size, that you’ll benefit more fully from your brain’s already established elasticity, or that the results of following this guidance can be measured by changes in blood flow and make thinking more clear and rational.

The philosophies and strategies espouds herein, are an attempt to invert the process of learning through meditation. Spending many hours in self-reflection will often produce numerous outward behavioural changes and changes to the thinking patterns you habituate. Perhaps it’s a reasonable hypothesis that tackling those thinking patterns will create new values that better serve you, or that developing new outward behaviours can facilitate desirable inner changes.

In any case, you can use this book as either a companion to, a preparation for, or an alternative to meditation.
