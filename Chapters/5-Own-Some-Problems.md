# Own Some Problems

Maybe you didn't create the problem. Maybe it wasn't your fault. Maybe you got away with it and nobody knows it was you. Maybe it's tiny. Maybe nobody really cares. Maybe it doesn't affect you or your friends. Maybe someone else will deal with it later. Maybe...

But maybe you could do something about it.

The best way to fix your bad habits, is to pick up after other people's bad habits. It's also the best way to avoid forming new bad habits. It makes you more aware of your negative impact (and we all have negative impact somewhere), and it helps rewrite the parts of your brain that create that negativity in the first place.

A good way to solve problems is to just start owning them. Start taking ownership (not blame), and make a difference.

Remember: If nobody owns a problem, it's not getting fixed. It's also free for the taking; I dare you to pick it up and feel good about making a difference.
